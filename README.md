# 🎵 Deezer Music Player (Capstone Project)

## 📌 Description

This project is a Deezer-inspired music player web application built as my capstone project.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of frontend development using React, working with APIs, and building a clean, responsive user interface.

The application allows users to browse music tracks and play 30-second previews through a simple and intuitive music player.
